feat(analysis): Implement heuristic tactical analysis system

This commit introduces a rule-based tactical analysis system to generate insights without relying on external generative AI.

Key changes:
- New `src/lib/tacticalAnalysis.ts`: Implements `analyzeTactics` to detect themes (Check, Mate, Stalemate, Capture, Promotion) and classify move quality (Blunder, Brilliant) based on evaluation differences.
- Database Schema (`prisma/schema.prisma`): Extended `CriticalMoment` model with `tactical` (boolean), `themes` (JSON), and `description` (text) fields.
- Analysis Hook (`src/hooks/useGameDatabase.ts`): Integrated tactical analysis into the `setGameEval` workflow. Now calculates `evalDiff` and populates the new fields during analysis.
- UI Updates (`analyzeButton.tsx`): Integrated new analysis logic.
- API (`import-bulk.ts`): Updates to game import logic and formatting.

Includes Prisma migration for the schema changes.
